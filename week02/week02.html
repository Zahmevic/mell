            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <h3>Chapter 1. "Hello, JavaScript"</h3>
            <p>Programming is basically a series of instructions that tell your computer how to perform a task.<br>
            <br>
                LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: can be difficult languages to
            program in because they involve writing abstract code that is heavily tied to a
            computer’s architecture.<br><br>
        HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Programs are
        written in a language such as C, C++ or Java, which is then compiled into
        machine code and executed. The programs written using these languages are very
        fast, making high-level languages suited to writing games and professional
        business software where speed is important. <br><br>
        JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that is interpreted and compiled at
        run time. JavaScript is also a dynamic language, so elements of a program can change while
        it’s running, and it can do lots of things in the background at run time (such as
        type checking, which we’ll cover later).<br>
        JavaScript made its debut in version 2 of Netscape’s Navigator browser in 1995.<br>
        HTML5 is the latest HTML specification, though it’s actually more of an umbrella
term for all the latest technologies that are used on the web. This includes HTML,
CSS3 and lots of APIs that use JavaScript to interact with web pages.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript in the Console.</strong> A console is a useful tool for experimenting and testing out pieces of code. 
            A console lets you see the results of each line of code as it is entered and is perfect for trying out small snippets of code.</li>
        <li><strong>Three Layers of the Web.</strong> Nearly all web pages are made up of three key ingredients ― HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. HTML is used to mark up the content. CSS is the presentation layer, and JavaScript adds the interactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement.</strong> Graceful degradation is the process of building a website so it works best in a
            modern browser that uses JavaScript, but still works to a reasonable standard in older browsers, or if JavaScript or some of its features are unavailable.<br>
            Progressive enhancement is the process of building a web page from the ground
            up with a base level of functionality, then adding extra enhancements if they are
            available in the browser. This should feel natural if you follow the principle of
            three layers, with the JavaScript layer enhancing the web page rather than being
            an essential element that the page cannot exist without.  </li>

            <h3>Chapter 4. "Functions"</h3>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, functions are considered to be first-class objects. This means they
behave in the same way as all the other primitive data types and objects in the
language. They can be be assigned to variables, stored in arrays and can even be
returned by another functions.<br>
Functions can be invoked or defining.
