            <h3>Chapter 10. "Testing and Debugging"</h3>
            <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there.
                In this chapter I learned about:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Errors, Exceptions and Warnings. </strong>
                <ul><li><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Exceptions are errors that produce a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Stack Traces. </strong>Is something that an exception produce.This is a sequence of functions or
                        method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. A stack trace will work
                        backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
                        function or method that started the sequence.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Warnings.</strong> A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the
                            program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.
                            This can be problematic, since the issue that produced
                            the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</li><br>
                </ul></li><br>
                <li><strong>The Importance of Testing and Debugging. </strong> A programmer should ensure that the code they write fails
                    loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. A programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully, so the
                    user experience is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure
                    exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Strict Mode. </strong>Strict Mode procudes more exceptions and warnings, and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. Writing code in strict mode can help improve its clarity and speed, and encourages a better quality of Javascript to be written.<br>
                        Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a
                        JavaScript file:
                        <strong>'use strict';</strong>
                    <ul><li><strong>Linting Tools. </strong>Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the
                            quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to
                            highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
                            if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. Linting tools
                            are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide.</li><br></ul></li><br>
                <li><strong>Feature Detection. </strong>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use
                                feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object
                                or method exists before trying to actually call the method. Feature detection guarantees that the method is only
                                called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being
                                thrown, if the method doesn’t exist.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Debugging in the Browser. </strong>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
                                    dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not
                                    always where it originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see
                                    what’s happening at different stages of its execution.<br>
                        <ul><li><strong>The Trusty Alert. </strong> The most basic form of debugging is to use the <i>alert()</i> method to show a dialog
                            at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until
                            OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us
                            check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to
                            be. Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript
                            development has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for
                            debugging purposes today.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Using the Console. </strong>Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a
                            number of methods for logging information and debugging. It’s not officially part
                            of the ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers
                            and Node.js. We can use <i>console.log()</i> to
                            log the value of variables at different stages of the program, and/or <i>console.trace()</i> to log an interactive stack trace in the
                            console.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging Tools.</strong> Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set
                            breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the
                            values of all the variables at those points and modify them. This can be very
                            useful when trying to track down bugs./li></ul></li><br>
                <li><strong>Error Objects. </strong>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception
                    occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.</li><br>
                    <ul><li><strong>Throwing Exceptions. </strong>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the
                        throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted
                        and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.
                        The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the
                        execution of the program to stop.</li></ul><br>
                <li><strong>Exception Handling. </strong>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is
                    ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production,
                    however, it will appear as if the program has crashed. </li><br>
                <li><strong>Tests. </strong>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing
                    good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will
                    be identified early on.
                <ul><li><strong>Test-driven Development. </strong>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual
                    code. Test-driven development is considered to be best practice, but in reality you’ll
                    find most developers tend to be more pragmatic when it comes to writing tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Frameworks. </strong>Testing
                    frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them.</li>
                <li><strong>Jest. </strong>Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of
                    popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper
                    methods for common test assertions.</li></ul></li><br>
