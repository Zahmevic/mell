            <h3>Chapter 8. "Forms"</h3>
            <p>In this chapter I learned about Forms, and how can I play with a form with JavaScript, the use of input, submit, and other attributes.I learned about new attibutes that can use in my form projects that I didn't know before read this.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><a href="hero.html"><strong>Hero Activity</strong></a></li>

            <h3>Chapter 12. "Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript"</h3>
            <p>This chapter was difficult for me to understand it because I coudn't make the examples with the book while I was reading, but I remembered that we can create classes and use prototypes, and properties and methods with this classes. When we create a class constructor, the first thing we need to check is if the prototype has inherit properties and methods.</p>
