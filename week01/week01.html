            <p>
                This week I read the first chapters, especially the section 3 of the chapter 2, I needed go the first 
                sections of this chapter because there was a hint that the book ask me for, I remembered lot of things that
                I was forget.

            <p>Since 2011 the movile devices started to have more popularity, people got moviles devices more than
                desktop devices, so the web sites need to improve their structure to give the best experience and services 
                to people who has movile devices, for that reason it is important to start working with the movile viewport and then increase
                the sizes until the desktop viewport.
