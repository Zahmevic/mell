            <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
            <h3>Chapter 5. "Objects"</h3>
            <p>In this chapter I learned that objects are a collection of key-value placed inside brackets "{}", also I learned that objects have properties, and this properties can be
                any JavaScript  value. I read about JSON, math and date objects and how can I use them in JavaScript </p>

            <h3>Chapter 6. "The Document Object Model"</h3>
            <p>In this Chapter I learned about the Document Object Model (DOM), and the chapter talked about document.getElementById, ByClassName, ByTagName, and the querySelector.
                The Book says that this can be used to access elements on the page. I also read about the parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes() and
                children() methods, this are used to navigate around the DOM tree.
                To access to the element attributes we can use the getAttribute() method, and to update the attibute, we can use setAttribute() method.

            <h3>Chapter 7. "Events"</h3>
            <p>In this chapter I learned that events occur when a user interacts with a web page. An event is attached to and element, and then invokes a callback function. When this occur, the event object pass as an argument, and it contains lots of properties and methods.
                There are many types of events.<br>
            To remove and event we can use the removeEventListener method.</p>
