<p>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and
    methods themselves. For example, all functions have a length property that
    returns the number of parameters the function has.</p><br>
    <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an
        object that is provided as the first argument. The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the
        function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument.</p><br>
    <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in
        a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the
        value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again. This is called as Memoization.</p><br>
    <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), is
        an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s
        defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
        definition. The function also
        has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole
        declaration inside parentheses.</p><br>
    <p>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s
        only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for
        again.</p><br>
    <p>practices. One of the problems with simply placing 'use strict' at the
        beginning of a file is that it will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the
        file, and if you’re using other people’s code, there’s no guarantee that they’ve
        coded in strict mode.
        To avoid this, the recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code
        inside an IIFE.</p><br>
