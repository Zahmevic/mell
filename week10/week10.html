            <h2>"Client-Side Form Validation"</h2>
            <p>
                Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called <strong>client-side form validation</strong>, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. <br><br>
                Client-side validation help us to bring a good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.<br><br>
                There are two different types of client-side validation:
<ul>
               <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, this validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li> 
<li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li> 
</ul>

            <h2>"Using FETCH"</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Fetch API</strong> provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. 
                The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax()<br><br>
                The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want to fetch — and returns a promise containing the response (a Response object). <br><br>
                The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings.
