            <h2>"Client-Side Form Validation"</h2>
            <p>
                Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called <strong>client-side form validation</strong>, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. <br><br>
                Client-side validation help us to bring a good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.<br><br>
                There are two different types of client-side validation:
<ul>
               <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, this validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li> 
<li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li> 
</ul>
