            <h2>Chapter 8. "CSS3 Transforms and Transitions"</h2>
            <p>
                In Chapter 8, I read about transforms and transitions, and with an example gave in the book, I could see
                the changes that we can make to a text, image or figure using transforms, scales and rotations.<br>
                The <strong>transform origin:</strong> is helpful to detect the rotation of a circle or oval.<br>
                In older versions of Internet Explorer, we can use <strong>filters</strong> to rotate something, however it's better use this web site to tranform and rotate something: http://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/ .<br>
