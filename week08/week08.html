            <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World</h2>
            <h2>Chapter 8. "CSS3 Transforms and Transitions"</h2>
            <p>
                In Chapter 8, I read about transforms and transitions, and with an example gave in the book, I could see
                the changes that we can make to a text, image or figure using transforms, scales and rotations.<br>
                The <strong>transform origin:</strong> is helpful to detect the rotation of a circle or oval.<br>
                In older versions of Internet Explorer, we can use <strong>filters</strong> to rotate something, however it's better use this web site to tranform and rotate something: http://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/ .<br>

            <h2>Chapter 12. "Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop"</h2>
            <p>
                In Chapter 12, I read about <strong>Canvas: </strong>With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines,
                arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate
                pixels in images and even video.<br>
                <strong>SVG: </strong>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file
                format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point
                of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG,
                and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink
                them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas,
                including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.<br>
                <strong>Drag and Drop: </strong>This API allows us to specify that certain
                elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable
                elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.
