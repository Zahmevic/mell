            <h2>Javascript. Novice to Ninja</h2>
            <h2>Chapter 09. "The Window Object"</h2>
            <p>
                I learned (and remembered), that bugs are unavoidable in code, and I need to find them earlier so I can fix them and don't have troubles in my codes, also I can use a strict mode in my js code using the "use strict" string. This string can be used in all the file or just in a function.<br>
                Sometimes our code can have a bug but continue working. The console and browserâ€™s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.<br>
                Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.
                The Jest framework can be used to test your code.

            <h2>Chapter 14. "HTML5 APIs"</h2>
            <p>
                HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript. <strong>data-</strong> attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.
                Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.
                The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
                The <strong>< audio > </strong>and <strong>< video ></strong> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.
                The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.
